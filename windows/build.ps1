# build.ps1 — build the DS Pinyin IME Windows frontend for one or more architectures.
#
# For each requested arch it:
#   1. Builds the Rust core (dsime) for the MSVC target -> dsime.dll + import lib.
#   2. Compiles the dictionary (dsime.lex) from the rime-frost sources, if they are
#      present. It is architecture-INDEPENDENT, so it is written once into dist/
#      regardless of how many arches were asked for.
#   3. Configures + builds the C++ TSF DLL and settings exe with CMake (VS 2022).
#   4. Stages the trio (dsime_tsf.dll, dsime.dll, DSPinyinIMESettings.exe) under
#      windows/dist/<arch>/ — the layout the installer bundles from.
#
# Run from a "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022" (PowerShell) or any
# PowerShell where MSVC + the Windows SDK + the Rust msvc toolchain are set up.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.ps1                       # build every supported arch (x64 + arm64)
#   ./build.ps1 -Arch x64             # just one
#   ./build.ps1 -Arch arm64 -Config Debug
#   ./build.ps1 -Arch x64 -SkipLexicon   # dist/dsime.lex is already built (CI)
#
# A requested arch whose Rust target or MSVC compiler is missing is skipped with
# a warning (so an x64-only CI runner still produces the x64 build).
