// Guids.h — stable GUIDs that identify this text service to TSF and the OS.
//
// These values are baked into the registry by DllRegisterServer and are how
// Windows finds and loads the IME. They MUST NOT change once shipped, otherwise
// existing user profiles / language-bar entries would dangle. If you fork this
// project, regenerate every GUID below with `uuidgen` so two builds never claim
// the same identity.
//
// We declare the GUIDs `extern` here and *define* them exactly once in
// Guids.cpp via the DEFINE_GUID machinery, so every translation unit shares one
// instance and the linker is happy.

#pragma once

// IMPORTANT: do NOT include <initguid.h> here. DEFINE_GUID expands to a plain
// `extern const GUID` declaration *unless* <initguid.h> was included earlier in
// the same translation unit, in which case it expands to a definition. Exactly
// one .cpp (Guids.cpp) includes <initguid.h> before this header, so the storage
// is emitted exactly once. Every other TU sees only declarations.
